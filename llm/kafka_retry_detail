The retry logic in this code does not pertain to an exception being thrown, instead, it retries certain operations if they do not initially meet a specified condition.;;;There is no request method being retried in this code. The retry operations in this code are associated with the methods "kafka.utils.timer.TimerTaskList.add" and "kafka.utils.timer.TimerTaskEntry.remove" where operations are retried based on certain conditions, not on the invocation of a specific request method.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/core/src/main/scala/kafka/controller/TopicDeletionManager.scala;;;kafka.controller.TopicDeletionManager.retryDeletionForIneligibleReplicas;;;The code provided does not specify explicit exceptions that lead to the retry operation. Instead, it checks various states and conditions (e.g., failure of Replica deletion, replicas being offline) that prompt Retry.;;;The request method being retried is not explicitly shown in the provided code. The method "retryDeletionForIneligibleReplicas" seems to handle retry logic, but it invokes "handleStateChanges" from the "replicaStateMachine" which is likely part of the retry process. However, the exact request method being retried isn't specified in the provided snippet.

However, there isn't a method explicitly named that performs the retry operation.;;;The provided code does not specify any exceptions that are being retried.;;;The provided code does not specify a request method that is being retried.
