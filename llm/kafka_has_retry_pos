['Does the following code perform retry anywhere? Please answer yes or no.', 'In which method is retry performed?']
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/CommonClientConfigs.java;;;Yes;;;The code provided does not perform a retry within any method. However, it does configure a settings for retry parameters such as "retries" and "retry.backoff.ms". The actual retry operation would be performed in some other part of the code (not provided here) that uses these configurations.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/internals/ProducerBatch.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is not directly performed in a specific method but a retry mechanism can be derived from the variable 'retry' being set in the method 'reenqueued', and the 'inRetry' method which returns the current value of the 'retry' variable. However, the actual code to retry on the basis of these methods is not present in this code.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/CreateTopicsOptions.java;;;Yes;;;The actual retry operation is not performed in any method shown in the code. It just provides an option to set whether quota violation should be automatically retried via the method "public CreateTopicsOptions retryOnQuotaViolation(boolean retryOnQuotaViolation)". The actual retry operation may be implemented somewhere else in the code that is not provided here.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/CreatePartitionsOptions.java;;;Yes;;;The code itself does not perform a retry. It just has a method (shouldRetryOnQuotaViolation) to get if the retryOnQuotaViolation flag is set or not and a method (retryOnQuotaViolation) to set this flag. The actual retry logic would be implemented somewhere else based on this flag.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/DeleteTopicsOptions.java;;;Yes;;;The actual retry operation is not performed in this code, however the method 'retryOnQuotaViolation' allows setting the condition under which a retry could occur. The actual retry logic would be elsewhere in the code where this condition is checked.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/AdminClientConfig.java;;;Yes;;;The code doesn't actually perform a retry operation. It just has a configuration entry named `RETRY_BACKOFF_MS_CONFIG` which can be used to set the amount of time to wait before trying a failed request again. The actual retry operation would be done elsewhere in the code using this configuration, but it's not in the provided code. So the answer to your previous question was incorrect. I apologize for any confusion.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/internals/DeleteConsumerGroupOffsetsHandler.java;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the 'handleGroupError' method.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/internals/AlterConsumerGroupOffsetsHandler.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in the `handleResponse` method.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/internals/CoordinatorStrategy.java;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the `handleError` method.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/internals/DeleteConsumerGroupsHandler.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in the `handleError` method.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/internals/DescribeTransactionsHandler.java;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the `handleError` method. It handles errors such as `COORDINATOR_LOAD_IN_PROGRESS`, `NOT_COORDINATOR`, and `COORDINATOR_NOT_AVAILABLE` that indicate a need to retry.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/internals/AdminApiDriver.java;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the following methods:\n- `onFailure(long currentTimeMs, RequestSpec<K> spec, Throwable t)`\n- `clearInflightRequest(long currentTimeMs, RequestSpec<K> spec)`\n- `retryLookup(Collection<K> keys)`
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/internals/PartitionLeaderStrategy.java;;;Yes;;;The retry mechanism is suggested in the `handleTopicError` and `handlePartitionError` methods. In both cases, if certain types of errors occur (e.g., `UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION`, `LEADER_NOT_AVAILABLE`, `BROKER_NOT_AVAILABLE`), a log message that includes the phrase "Will retry" is printed. However, the actual retry logic (like a loop or recursive call) is not present in the given code. The "retry" mentioned in the log message suggests that the retry will be handled by some other part of the system.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/internals/ListConsumerGroupOffsetsHandler.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in the `handleGroupError` method. If the custom error handling finds a coordinate load in progress, or if the coordinator is not available, or not a coordinator, the program will retry.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/internals/AdminApiHandler.java;;;Yes;;;The retry mechanism is inferred in the handleResponse method. If the response contains a retriable error, the key associated with that error is left out of the result and gets retried automatically. Also, if the response indicates an incorrect target brokerId, the key will be "unmapped" from the target brokerId and lookup will be retried. However, the actual implementation of the retry logic is not shown in this code.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/internals/DescribeProducersHandler.java;;;Yes;;;The retry mechanism is performed in the handlePartitionError method. Specifically, it handles exceptions such as NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER and UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION by marking the TopicPartition as unmapped which indirectly implies a retry mechanism when a new leader is found or the unknown topic/partition becomes known. However, the actual retry code is not present in this class and likely resides in higher level caller code. By returning certain errors, this class is signaling to the caller code that they may want to retry the request.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/internals/DescribeConsumerGroupsHandler.java;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the "handleError" method. Specifically, when the errors are either COORDINATOR_LOAD_IN_PROGRESS, COORDINATOR_NOT_AVAILABLE, or NOT_COORDINATOR, a retry mechanism is mentioned or initiated.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/internals/FenceProducersHandler.java;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the `handleError` method.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/internals/AllBrokersStrategy.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in the "handleResponse" method. If the Metadata response contained no brokers, it logs the event and then returns an empty LookupResult, suggesting the action will be retried.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/internals/AdminApiLookupStrategy.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is implicitly performed in the "handleResponse" method. According to the comments in the code, keys which receive a retriable error should be left out of the result. They will be retried automatically by the system.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/internals/RemoveMembersFromConsumerGroupHandler.java;;;Yes;;;The retry operation is implied in the "handleGroupError" method, specifically for the cases COORDINATOR_LOAD_IN_PROGRESS, COORDINATOR_NOT_AVAILABLE, and NOT_COORDINATOR. However, the exact code to perform the retry is not shown here, and is likely handled in a different part of the codebase.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/internals/AbortTransactionHandler.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in the "handleError" method.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/internals/OffsetsForLeaderEpochClient.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in the `handleResponse` method.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/internals/DefaultEventHandler.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is setup in the DefaultEventHandler constructor where the creation of the `ConsumerNetworkClient` instance takes place. The `config.getLong(ConsumerConfig.RETRY_BACKOFF_MS_CONFIG)` parameter sets up the retry backoff timing. However, the actual retry execution is likely to be performed within the `ConsumerNetworkClient`, which is not shown in the provided code snippet. So, although the configuration for retry is present in the provided code, the specific method where the retry is actually performed isn't visibly present in this provided code snippet.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/Uuid.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in the `randomUuid` method.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/security/kerberos/KerberosError.java;;;Yes;;;The code itself does not perform a retry operation. It only defines whether a certain Kerberos error can be retried or not using a boolean flag 'retriable'. The actual retry logic would be implemented elsewhere in the application where these errors are handled. Based on the 'retriable' flag, the error can be retried. So while it pertains to retry, the retry is not actually performed within this code.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/security/kerberos/KerberosLogin.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in the "login()" method. This is seen in the following blocks of code:\n\n1. \n```\nwhile (retry >= 0) {\n    try {\n        log.debug("[Principal={}]: Running ticket cache refresh command: {} {}", principal, kinitCmd, kinitArgs);\n        Shell.execCommand(kinitCmd, kinitArgs);\n        break;\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        if (retry > 0) {\n            log.warn("[Principal={}]: Error when trying to renew with TicketCache, but will retry ", principal, e);\n            --retry;\n            // sleep for 10 seconds\n            try {\n                Thread.sleep(10 * 1000);\n            } catch (InterruptedException ie) {\n                log.error("[Principal={}]: Interrupted while renewing TGT, exiting Login thread", principal);\n                return;\n            }\n        } \n        ...\n```\n2. \n```\ntry {\n    int retry = 1;\n    while (retry >= 0) {\n        try {\n            reLogin();\n            break;\n        } catch (LoginException le) {\n            if (retry > 0) {\n                log.warn("[Principal={}]: Error when trying to re-Login, but will retry ", principal, le);\n                --retry;\n                // sleep for 10 seconds.\n                try {\n                    Thread.sleep(10 * 1000);\n                } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n                    log.error("[Principal={}]: Interrupted during login retry after LoginException:", principal, le);\n                    throw le;\n                }\n            } \n            ...\n```
['Does the following code perform retry anywhere? Please answer yes or no.', 'In which method is retry performed?']
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/security/oauthbearer/internals/expiring/ExpiringCredentialRefreshingLogin.java;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the "run" method of the "Refresher" inner class.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/security/oauthbearer/internals/secured/Retry.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in the "execute" method.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/security/oauthbearer/internals/secured/HttpAccessTokenRetriever.java;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the "retrieve" method.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/security/oauthbearer/internals/secured/RefreshingHttpsJwks.java;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the method `refresh`.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/tools/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/tools/VerifiableConsumer.java;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the method "commitSync".
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/core/src/main/scala/kafka/zk/ZkMigrationClient.scala;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in the following methods:\n- getOrCreateMigrationRecoveryState()\n- setMigrationRecoveryState()\n- claimControllerLeadership()\n- releaseControllerLeadership()\n- updateTopicPartitions()\n- createTopic()\n- tryWriteEntityConfig()\n- writeClientQuotas()\n- writeProducerId()\n- writeConfigs() \n\nIn all of these methods, retry occurs via the method zkClient.retryMigrationRequestsUntilConnected() where if an operation initially fails due to some transient issue (like a network disconnect), it will attempt to perform the operation again until it is successful.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/core/src/main/scala/kafka/tools/MirrorMaker.scala;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the method called `commitOffsets()`.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/core/src/main/scala/kafka/tools/JmxTool.scala;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the main method, specifically in the do-while loop used for establishing the JMX connection.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/core/src/main/scala/kafka/coordinator/transaction/ProducerIdManager.scala;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the "getNewProducerIdBlock" method of the "ZkProducerIdManager" object and "maybeRequestNextBlock" method of the "RPCProducerIdManager" class.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/core/src/main/scala/kafka/coordinator/transaction/TransactionMarkerRequestCompletionHandler.scala;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the onComplete(response: ClientResponse): Unit method.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/core/src/main/scala/kafka/coordinator/group/DelayedJoin.scala;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in the `onComplete()` method of `InitialDelayedJoin` class. If new members have been added to the group and there is still time remaining before the rebalance timeout, the method schedules a further delay, effectively retrying the operation.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/core/src/main/scala/kafka/utils/timer/TimerTaskList.scala;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the "add" and "remove" methods of the TimerTaskEntry class.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/core/src/main/scala/kafka/controller/TopicDeletionManager.scala;;;Yes;;;The retry mechanism is performed in the "resumeDeletions" method.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/trogdor/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/trogdor/coordinator/NodeManager.java;;;Yes;;;The code comments mention the presence of some complexity due to retries in the "CreateWorker" method, but the provided code doesn't explicitly show any retry logic. The actual execution of retries might be hidden in functions being called (for example within the 'client.createWorker' and 'client.stopWorker' methods), but that is not visible from the given code snippet.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/trogdor/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/trogdor/coordinator/CoordinatorClient.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in methods such as:\n\n- `status()`\n- `uptime()`\n- `createTask(CreateTaskRequest request)`\n- `stopTask(StopTaskRequest request)`\n- `destroyTask(DestroyTaskRequest request)`\n- `tasks(TasksRequest request)`\n- `task(TaskRequest request)`\n- `shutdown()`\n\nThese methods use the `JsonRestServer.httpRequest()` function, which performs the retry, with the maximum number of tries specified by the `maxTries` variable.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/trogdor/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/trogdor/agent/AgentClient.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in all HTTP requests methods which include `status()`, `uptime()`, `createWorker(CreateWorkerRequest request)`, `stopWorker(StopWorkerRequest request)`, `destroyWorker(DestroyWorkerRequest request)`, and `invokeShutdown()`. These methods make use of the `JsonRestServer.httpRequest()` method which implements the retry logic based on the `maxTries` variable.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/trogdor/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/trogdor/workload/Throttle.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in the "increment" method. It uses a while loop to check for a condition and repeats its block of code until the condition is met.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/trogdor/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/trogdor/rest/JsonRestServer.java;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the "httpRequest" methods that accept a "maxTries" parameter.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/processor/internals/RepartitionTopics.java;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the `setRepartitionSourceTopicPartitionCount` method. The method employs a do-while loop which continues to iterate until the partition count is resolved for all repartition topics. If the number of partitions for a topic can't be resolved in a given iteration, the loop repeats (implying a retry mechanism) to ensure that all repartitioning topics have been assigned a partition count.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/processor/internals/StreamsProducer.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in the "initTransaction()" method. In case of a TimeoutException during transaction initialization, it suggests to retry initializing the task in the next loop.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/processor/internals/TaskExecutor.java;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the "processTask" method. It specifically addresses the TimeoutException with a retry mechanism. If a TimeoutException is thrown while processing a task, the task timeout is initialized or the exception is thrown, and the task will be retried later.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/processor/internals/GlobalStateManagerImpl.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in the method "retryUntilSuccessOrThrowOnTaskTimeout".
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/processor/internals/AbstractTask.java;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the method "maybeInitTaskTimeoutOrThrow".
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/processor/internals/RecordCollectorImpl.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in the "send" method. Specifically, in the portion where "partitionsFor" method is called on "streamsProducer" object. If a TimeoutException occurs, a warn message is logged and the TimeoutException is re-thrown which leads to a retry.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/processor/internals/namedtopology/KafkaStreamsNamedTopologyWrapper.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in the `resetOffsets` method.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/storage/api/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/server/log/remote/storage/RemoteLogSegmentState.java;;;Yes;;;The code above does not explicitly contain a retry operation in any specific method. However, the comment mentions that if a segment is in the same source and target state, it is considered a valid transition, which could account for retries or failover scenarios. This mechanism is implemented in the method isValidTransition. This method checks the validity of a state transition, and a self transition (re-trying the same state) is considered valid here. But it does not directly handle retries mechanism; it just allows such behavior.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/storage/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/server/log/remote/storage/RemoteLogManagerConfig.java;;;Yes;;;The given code does not contain any method where retry is performed. However, it provides some configuration options which might be utilized by some methods elsewhere for retry mechanism, such as `REMOTE_LOG_MANAGER_TASK_RETRY_BACK_OFF_MS_PROP` and `REMOTE_LOG_MANAGER_TASK_RETRY_BACK_OFF_MAX_MS_PROP`.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/storage/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/server/log/remote/metadata/storage/ConsumerManager.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in the `waitTillConsumptionCatchesUp` method.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/examples/src/main/java/kafka/examples/KafkaExactlyOnceDemo.java;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the "recreateTopics" method.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/raft/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/raft/RequestManager.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in the `isReady` method of the `ConnectionState` class, where it checks if the backoff time has completed or if the request has timed out, and if so, it sets the state ready again. This effectively retries the connection upon the next call to the method `isReady`. The logical concept of retry is also associated with the methods `onResponseError` and `onRequestSent` in the `ConnectionState` class.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/raft/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/raft/ResignedState.java;;;Yes;;;The retry mechanism is not directly implemented in a particular method within this code. However, the code comment states that retries can potentially occur during the resignation process when sending `EndQuorumEpoch` requests to unacknowledged voters in `unackedVoters()`. The `acknowledgeResignation(int voterId)` method can also play a part in a retry mechanism by preventing unnecessary retries after a successful `EndQuorumEpoch` response.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/raft/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/raft/CandidateState.java;;;Yes;;;The code does not invoke any explicit method to perform a retry. However, it does contain a mechanism for a retry in the process of attempting to get elected as a leader in a Raft-based system. This is handled through the backoff mechanism represented by the variable "isBackingOff" and the method "startBackingOff". When an election attempt fails, the system backs off for a certain time and then presumably a new election attempt (retry) would be initiated. However, this specific retry initiation isn't visible in this code snippet.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/util/RetryUtil.java;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the method named "retryUntilTimeout".
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/ConnectorConfig.java;;;Yes;;;The code provided does not directly perform any retry; rather, it provides configuration options for other pieces of code where retry procedures might be implemented. The option for setting a retry timeout is provided with `ERRORS_RETRY_TIMEOUT_CONFIG`, and the maximum delay between retries is specified by `ERRORS_RETRY_MAX_DELAY_CONFIG`. However, actual retry logic implementation is not present in this provided code.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/ExactlyOnceWorkerSourceTask.java;;;Yes;;;There is no specific method that performs a retry operation in the given code. The usage of `RetryWithToleranceOperator` object is present, but its methods are not directly called in this code excerpt. So, there is no explicit retry mechanism defined in the given code.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/WorkerTask.java;;;Yes;;;The code does not directly perform any retry operation. However, it uses `RetryWithToleranceOperator` class for handling operations that could possibly be retried (based on their implementation), but the provided code does not show any explicit retry mechanism.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/ConnectMetricsRegistry.java;;;Yes;;;The code does not perform a retry in any method.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/TransformationChain.java;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the apply method.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/errors/WorkerErrantRecordReporter.java;;;Yes;;;The retry is performed in the `report` method with the call to `retryWithToleranceOperator.executeFailed(...)`.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/errors/RetryWithToleranceOperator.java;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the "execAndRetry" method.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/storage/KafkaStatusBackingStore.java;;;Yes;;;Retry is performed in the `send` method. If the status update fails with a `RetriableException`, the method does another `kafkaLog.send`. Retrying is also done on the `onCompletion` callback of `sendConnectorStatus`, `sendTaskStatus`, and `sendTopicStatus` methods.
./repos/kafka_c6590ee/connect/api/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/sink/SinkTask.java;;;Yes;;;Retry can be performed in the "put" method. It is mentioned in the comments of the method that if the operation fails, the SinkTask may throw a RetriableException to indicate that the framework should attempt to retry the same call again.
