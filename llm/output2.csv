org/apache/hadoop/hbase/master/procedure/SchemaLocking$1.class;;;As an AI language model, I cannot determine whether the given class has functionality that might be described as a "state machine" as insufficient information is provided. The class name only indicates the package and class name, but it does not provide any specific details regarding the functionality or behavior of the class.

org/apache/hadoop/hbase/master/procedure/SnapshotRegionProcedure.class;;;It is difficult to determine conclusively whether this class has functionality that might be described as a "state machine" without seeing the full implementation. However, based on the methods that are visible, it is possible that this class may use some state machine-like functionality. For example, the class implements the Procedure interface, which is often used to implement state machines in HBase, and it has methods such as getProcName() and getTableOperationType(), which suggest that the class may have different states or modes of operation.

org/apache/hadoop/hbase/master/procedure/SplitWALRemoteProcedure.class;;;Yes. It is possible that the class has functionality that might be described as a "state machine", as it is designed to handle a complex procedure (SplitWALRemoteProcedure) that involves multiple steps and can have different outcomes depending on various conditions. The class has methods to get the current state and operation type, as well as methods to initiate and perform the different stages of the procedure. These features are typical of a state machine, which is a computational model that can represent complex systems or processes as a set of states and transitions between them.;;;Y
org/apache/hadoop/hbase/master/procedure/SwitchRpcThrottleProcedure$1.class;;;As an AI language model, I am not able to determine if the given class has functionality that might be described as a "state machine" as it requires a deeper understanding of the context and the behavior of the class.
